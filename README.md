Kayako Java API library
=======================

This library is maintained by Kayako.

* Documentation: http://wiki.kayako.com/display/DEV/Java+API+Library
* Project tracker: http://dev.kayako.com/browse/JAVAAPI

### Build instructions
To build the library, just run `ant` from the command line and the jar file will be placed on the `dist` directory.

### Disabling debugging
If you wish to disable the debugging information in the library, just set `debug="false"` in the javac section of build.xml.

The debugging information is useful in the IDEs to navigate the library code and to find the source of the exceptions when the information on the Wiki is not enough.
